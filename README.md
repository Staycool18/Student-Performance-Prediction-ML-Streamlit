## 🔍 Overview

This ML-based project predicts a student's **final performance** using multiple features such as:

- Socioeconomic Score  
- Study Hours
- Sleep Hours
- Attendance (%) 
- Performance (Medium)
- Performance (High)

The model predicts the student's final grade/classification, helping in early intervention or support strategies.
